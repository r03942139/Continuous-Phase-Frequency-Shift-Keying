# Continuous-Phase-Frequency-Shift-Keying Modulation System
This is the GNU-Octave simulation and TI OMAP system codes for Continuous Phase Frequency Shift Keying Modulation.
Both wire and wireless(antenna) solution is included.

# Project Features
Built a CPFSK modulation system using C/C++/Matlab and designed features including wired channel and antenna transmission.
* Achieved best channel error rate performance (8.39%) among 15 groups in the lab contest under strong noise environment.
* Acted as a software lead in group and improved the system robustness by 15% compared to original QPSK solution.
